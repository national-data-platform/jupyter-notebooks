    "# 10 Minutes for Streaming from a POP\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **10 Minutes for Streaming from a POP** tutorial! This notebook demonstrates the core functionalities of the `scidx_streaming` library, which allows you to create and interact with streaming data using the sciDX platform and a Point of Presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "1. Set up the library and authenticate with the API.\n",
    "2. Create, consume, and manage Kafka streams.\n",
    "3. Use filter semantics for advanced data processing."
